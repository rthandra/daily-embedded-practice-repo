Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.


SOL:

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int count = 0; //return the length of last word
        int i = size(s)-1;
        

        while (s[i] == ' ') i--;

        //if last index is not space, keep moving i
        while(s[i] != ' '){
                count++;
                i--;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
