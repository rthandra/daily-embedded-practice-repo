Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x.

Example 1:

Input: n = 27
Output: true
Explanation: 27 = 33
Example 2:

Input: n = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3x = 0.
Example 3:

Input: n = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3x = (-1).








/*

power of 3 is made of three multiplied repeatdly so you divide until all 3's are peeled off

power of 3 value repeatdly divided by 3 leads to 1 in the end and the reminder is always 0 for any value that is power of 3 or multiplier of 3 but multiplier of 3 is not the same as power of 3 so you need to check for 1 in the end

27/3 = 9/3 = 3/3 = 1
6/3 = 2/3 != 1
brute force:

edge case: n cannot be 0 or negative values

loop until reminded of n and 3 is 0:
    repeatdly divide n by 3

if n is 1:
    true
false


optimized: without loop

the highest power of 3 should be divided by n - because highest power is consists of all the powers under it
