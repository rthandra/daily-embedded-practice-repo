You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 45

/*
- where was my last step at? was one step away or two steps? so n - 1 , n - 2 so total ways is (n - 1) + (n - 2)
- can compute a table for all numbers
 for ex if n = 3, so 0->3
    fibonacci series: 0 1 -> default
    1 -> 0 + 1 = 1
    2 = 1 + 1 = 2
    3 = 2 + 1 = 3
    4 = 3 + 2 = 5
    5 = 5 + 3 = 8
    set 0th and 1th position as 0 and one
        pre intialize arr 0th and 1st index as 0 and 1
        loop until n:
            start at index 2 until n + 1:
                every index value is its sum of prev two values
