Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.

/*
    loop until fast and fast next exists:
        if left and right intersect:
            restart fast to head
            loop until fast and slow are equal:
                now check again if they are equal:
                    return node
    return null;

    setting one pointer to start and checking again makes it reach the correct node - floyds algorithm
