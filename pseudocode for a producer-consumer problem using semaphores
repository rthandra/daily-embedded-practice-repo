consumer sends a signal that its ready,receives data

//shared buffer
buffer[N] //buffer size of N
int = 0; //index for producer
out = 0;//index for consumer

//semaphores

wait
empty
full

//producer

void producer(){
    wait(empty)//checks if there is atleast one slot, if there is one we decrement
    wait(mutex)//enter critical section 
    
    buffer[in] = item;
    in = in%N //moves to the next index
    
    signal(mutex) //to leave the critical section
    signal(full) //increment full by one because we just added a value and notifies customer that
    
}

void consumer(){
    wait(full) //wait if the buffer is empty
    wait(mutex)//enter buffer
    
    item = buffer[out]; //consume the data
    out = out % N
    
    signal(mutex)//leaving mutex
    signal(empty) //notifies producer that there is free space
    
    removes the latest item consumed
