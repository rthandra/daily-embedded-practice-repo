Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

SOLUTION
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct ListNode *next;
 * };
 */
 //using the dummy node, the algorithm can always safely modify prev->next, regardless of whether the node being removed is at the head or elsewhere in the list.
struct ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(struct ListNode* head, int n) {
    //1. two pointer in n difference between each other
    //2. how would you find the difference? subtract n  = 0; get the exact value of the difference
    //3. now increment both the pointers until curr becomes null, prev would be at the exact place to be deleted
    //the above logic is complicated, we can just run a for loop to calculate the n positions
    struct ListNode *dummy =  (struct ListNode *)malloc(sizeof(struct ListNode ));
    dummy->next = head;
    int count = n;
    struct ListNode *prev = dummy;
    struct ListNode *curr = head;

    for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){ //by the end of the loop curr will be at the exact position of n
        curr = curr->next;
    }

    while(curr != NULL){
        curr = curr->next;
        prev = prev->next;  
    }

    prev->next= prev->next->next; //skip node
    
    return dummy->next;
} 

method 2: 

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct ListNode *next;
 * };
 */
struct ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(struct ListNode* head, int n) {

    struct ListNode dummy;
    dummy.next = head;
    struct ListNode *slow = &dummy;
    struct ListNode *right = head;

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        right = right->next;
    } 

    while(right){
        slow = slow->next;
        right = right->next;
    }
    slow->next = slow->next->next;

    return dummy.next;

}
